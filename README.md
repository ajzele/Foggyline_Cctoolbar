Foggyline_Cctoolbar
===================

This extension will allow you to do slight modifications to catalog toolbar, such as merge/combine "Sort by" and "order", custom labels for "Sort by", etc. This extension was originally built and tested on Magento CE v1.8.1.0.

Once installed, extension can be further configured under `System > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog > Foggyline | Configurable catalog toolbar`. By default extension output is disabled, until configuration option `Enabled` is set to `Yes`.
